# wvrand

A simple toolset for a few `random` related tasks that I made as an exercise.
Binary can be run with one of a few commands, each one provides a small help,
which can be accessed by the `-h` key.

## Commands

These commands are available as part of the program:

* `bytes` returns endless uniform stream of bytes generated by the
          [MWC](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/mwc-random-0.14.0.0)
          Stateful RNG.
* `lazybytes` does the same thing as the previous command, but uses stateless
              `RandomGen` and lazy `ByteString`s.
* `password` generates random password-like string of the desired length, that
             contains upper and lower case letters, digits and special symbols.
* `dice` throws your dice. Accepts dice in the usual `DnD` form, i.e. `2d8`.
